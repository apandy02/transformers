These epochs, however, take tremendously long (7 minutes per epoch v/s the 1 minute LSTMs were taking). Part of this could be becauase of the implementation being from scratch (torch.transformer might be faster), but most of this comes from the computational load the multiple blocks (and their individual complexities)\n",
